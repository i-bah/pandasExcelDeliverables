# writeToExcelPandasNum
This code reads user data from an Excel file named "usrData9.xlsx" and a sheet named "usersData8".
If the file or the sheet does not exist, the code creates an empty DataFrame to store the user data.
Then, the code prompts the user to enter their first name, last name, and date of birth. After that,
the code calculates the user's age based on their date of birth and adds the user data and calculated age to the DataFrame.
Finally, the updated user data is written back to the Excel file.
